      <h3>Unfinished Business From Last Week</h3>
      <p>1: This was left over, we need to address first. We will soon decide what it is. These people need to be involved.
        This should also be done with that. And this is when it should be done.</p>
      
      <h3>New Business to Address</h3>
      <p>1: This is our first new item. This is what it is. Who needs to do what and when i'm not sure but we'll figure it
        out. We could also do this and that. This is pretty important.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>2: Another item to address. This is what it is. These people need to work on it and have it in the back of their
        mind. It's not super pressing but we need it before this meeting. Maybe ask these people to give info to help.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>3: This is the last item. This is it. It should be very quick, just to do during this meeting. Everyong do this 
        right now and work on it really quick. We might do this again next meeting if we all like it.</p>
