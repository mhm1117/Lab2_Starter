      <h3>Unfinished Business From Last Week</h3>
      <p>1: This was left over, we need to address first. We will soon decide what it is. These people need to be involved.<br>
        This should also be done with that. And this is when it should be done.</p>
  
      <h3>New Business to Address</h3>
      <p>1: This is our first new item. This is what it is. Who needs to do what and when i'm not sure but we'll figure it out.<br> 
        We could also do this and that. This is <b>pretty important</b>.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>2: Another item to address. This is what it is. These people need to work on it and have it in the back of their
        mind.<br> 
        It's not super pressing but we need it <strong>before</strong> next meeting. Maybe ask certain people to give info<br>
        to help.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>3: This is the last item. This is it. It should be very quick, just to do during this meeting. Everyong do this<br>
        right now and work on it really quick. We <em>might</em> do this again next meeting if we all like it. <i>Who knows!</i></p>
